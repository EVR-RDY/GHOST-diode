# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format follows **SemVer** for versions and a **track suffix** where helpful:

- `-poc` for PoC track releases (v0.x)
- No suffix for product releases (v1.x and beyond)

## [v0.1.0-poc] - 2025-09-14
### Added
- Initial PoC documentation: overview, architecture, build guide, validation, safety/risk, roadmap.
- BOM draft, wiring notes, loopback/negative tests.
- Validation scripts for basic outbound-only checks.
- CERN OHL v2-P licence and open hardware framing.
